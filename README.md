# ! Not fully working yet !

A quick and dirty CLI version of IgorTimofeevs [OCIFImageConverter](https://github.com/IgorTimofeev/OCIFImageConverter).

This software is designed to convert any real images into OCIF images. The format created for the OpenComputers minecraft modification. It supports dithering, and Braille font, which allows you to break limit of 160x50 pixels and use up to 320x200.

This fork is made to convert whole folders at once keeping the original resolution. To get a smooth work flow using OCIF images in bigger projects.

# Requirements
Java8
Lua 5.x
LuaFileSystem (lsf)

# Dev note
This fork is made for our personal usage only. Thats why there is not polishing or a proper documentary yet.  
But I am willing to help get it running if someone actually want to use it. Just open a issue pls.

Also I have no idea about java. So im using lua for the most parts.
